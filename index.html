          Over the years I've been lucky enough that I have been able to travel
          to 13 countries around the world. Travelling is not only a very fun
          experience, but it opens you up to alternate world views you would not
          get elsewhere. This website is intended as a compilation of a few of
          the place's I have travelled to, all of which provided me different
          experiences. The three options I picked are, Gothenburg in Sweden,
          Filzmoosalm in Austria, and San Jose del Cabo in Mexico.

          <h2>Gothenburg, Sweden</h2>
          <h2 id="swedenTime"></h2>
          <p>
            Along the south-west coast of Sweden lies the city of Gothenburg.
            Being the second largest city in the country it is only natural that
            there is plenty to do there. From the scenic archipeligo where one can
            ferry around multiple islands surrounding the city, to the
            free zoo or "Djurgarden" in the center of the city.
            Gothenburg is a beautiful place with a bustling cafe scene, and i couldn't recommend visiting the place
            more.

          <h2>San Jose del Cabo, Mexico</h2>
          <h2 id="caboTime"></h2>
          <p>
            Mexico is known far and wide for it's beautiful sandy beaches and
            its tropical climate. San Jose del cabo is no exception to this. Nestled inside Baja Calafornia sur, Cabo has long stretched of beaches as well as amazing rock formations along its coast. For those with access to a vehicle, San Jose del Cabo is close to several spots worth visiting such as Cabo San Lucas, waterfalls in Santiago, or Hotel California in Todo Santos.

          <h2>Filzmoosalm, Austria</h2>
          <h2 id="austriaTime"></h2>
          <p>
            While there are many things do do and see in Austria, the best experience i had was at a small alm on top of a mountain. Filzmoosalm is located atop filzmooshorndl near grobbarl austria. Not only are the mountains themselves gorgeuous, the alm was incredibly charming. The alm was essentially a small, free-range cattle farm that harkened back to a simpler time. With no electricity, you would socialize with other travelers at night, and had the opportunity to wake up at 4am to help herd the cattle down the mountain.

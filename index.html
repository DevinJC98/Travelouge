          Over the years I've been lucky enough that I have been able to travel
          to 13 countries around the world. Travelling is not only a very fun
          experience, but it opens you up to alternate world views you would not
          get elsewhere. This website is intended as a compilation of a few of
          the place's I have travelled to, all of which provided me different
          experiences. The three options I picked are, Gothenburg in Sweden,
          Filzmoosalm in Austria, and San Jose del Cabo in Mexico.

          <h2>Gothenburg, Sweden</h2>
          <h2 id="swedenTime"></h2>
          <p>
            
            Along the south-west coast of Sweden lies the city of Gothenburg. Being the second largest city in the country it is only natural that there is plenty to do there. From the scenic archipelago where one can ferry around multiple islands surrounding the city, to the only free zoo in Sweden, each day in the city could be unique. Gothenburg is a beautiful place with a bustling cafe scene, and I couldn't recommend visiting the place more.

          <h2>San Jose del Cabo, Mexico</h2>
          <h2 id="caboTime"></h2>
          <p>
            Mexico is known far and wide for its beautiful sandy beaches and its tropical climate. San José del Cabo is no exception to this. Nestled inside Baja California Sur, Cabo has long stretched of beaches as well as amazing rock formations along its coast. If somehow you get sick of the beaches, San Jose del Cabo is also close to several spots such as Cabo San Lucas, waterfalls in Santiago, or Hotel California in Todo Santos which are all worth a trip.

          <h2>Filzmoosalm, Austria</h2>
          <h2 id="austriaTime"></h2>
          <p>
            While there are many things to do and see in Austria, the best experience I had was at a small hut on top of a mountain. Filzmoosalm is located atop Filzmooshörndl(A mountain near Großarl). Not only are the mountains themselves gorgeous, Filzmoosalm was an incredibly charming location. There is no electricity or internet connection, and the ambience harkens back to a simpler time in life. A time where you have a man with a gruff German accent wake you up at 4am to help herd cattle down the mountain.
